# Telegram Finance Bot

## Project Description

Telegram Finance Bot is a powerful tool for managing personal finances directly within Telegram. The bot helps users track their income and expenses, maintain statistics, and categorize expenses into various categories. In the future, we plan to add many useful features, including integration with GPT-based chat for financial data analysis and report generation.

## Key Features (In Development)
- **Receipt Scanning:** Automatically recognize information from paper receipts and add them to your financial journal.
- **Income and Expense Tracking:** Easily monitor your financial flows with detailed statistics.
- **Expense Categorization:** Automatically and manually classify expenses into predefined categories.
- **ChatGPT Integration:** Ask questions and receive financial advice from a smart GPT-based chatbot.
- **And much more:** Continuous addition of new features to make financial management as easy and convenient as possible.

## Future Plans
- **Bank Integration:** Connect to bank accounts for automatic transaction data import.
- **Multi-User Support:** Manage family budgets or shared finances.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Create graphs and charts for a clearer representation of financial information.
- **Data Export:** Export data in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.) for use in other applications.
